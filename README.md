The Customer Churn Prediction Project uses Python to analyze and predict customer churn. Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) uncover trends and key factors driving churn. Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost are applied to train and test the model. The model predicts the likelihood of customers leaving, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain customers, reduce churn rates, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
